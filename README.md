This project demonstrates various data extraction techniques using Python, including:

- Extracting data from CSV files using `pandas`
- Fetching data from APIs with `requests`
- Connecting to databases of SQL Server using  `SQLAlchemy`
- Web scraping dynamic content using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`
